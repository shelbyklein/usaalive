# Feature Request: Multiview Display System

**Date**: 2025-01-16
**Priority**: Critical
**Status**: Approved

## Description
Implement a comprehensive multiview display system that allows operators to simultaneously monitor multiple camera feeds in configurable grid layouts. This is a core feature essential for professional live production, broadcasting, and multi-camera operations.

## Use Case
- **Live Event Directors**: Need to monitor all camera angles simultaneously to make real-time switching decisions
- **Security Operators**: Require comprehensive surveillance coverage with all cameras visible at once
- **Broadcast Engineers**: Need multiview monitoring with preview/program capabilities for professional switching workflows
- **Content Creators**: Want to see all available camera angles during multi-camera productions
- **Camera Operators**: Need visual feedback from multiple camera perspectives during training and operation

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Grid Layout System**: Support for 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 4x5, and custom grid arrangements
- **Simultaneous NDI Rendering**: Display 4-16+ camera feeds simultaneously via NDI streams
- **Camera Selection**: Click-to-select cameras with visual feedback and active camera highlighting
- **Camera Status Indicators**: Per-camera connection status, signal quality, and health monitoring
- **Camera Labeling**: Customizable text labels for each camera feed (e.g., "CAM 1", "Wide Shot", "Close-up")
- **Preview/Program Workflow**: Professional switching with preview selection and program output
- **Fullscreen Toggle**: Double-click or hotkey to switch between grid view and fullscreen single camera
- **Dynamic Layout Switching**: Runtime switching between different grid configurations
- **Camera Feed Management**: Add/remove cameras from grid without application restart

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Maintain 30+ FPS for 4-9 camera grids, 24+ FPS for 16+ camera grids
- **Memory Efficiency**: Scale memory usage appropriately (2-4GB for 4-16 cameras)
- **Network Optimization**: Efficient NDI stream management with bandwidth awareness
- **Responsiveness**: UI remains responsive during video rendering operations
- **Quality Management**: Dynamic resolution scaling based on grid size and available resources

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Complexity
- **High**: Requires custom video grid rendering system with Unity UI Toolkit integration
- **NDI Integration**: Must extend KlakNDI plugin usage for multiple simultaneous receivers
- **Performance Optimization**: Complex GPU texture management and memory optimization required
- **UI Architecture**: Sophisticated dynamic layout system with responsive design

### Dependencies
- **KlakNDI Plugin 2.1.4**: Core dependency for NDI video streaming
- **Unity UI Toolkit**: Modern UI framework for responsive grid layouts
- **Unity Render Pipeline**: Efficient texture streaming and GPU memory management
- **Network Infrastructure**: Reliable gigabit+ ethernet for multiple HD streams

### Potential Challenges
- **GPU Memory Management**: Efficient handling of multiple high-resolution video textures
- **Network Bandwidth**: Managing 100-500 Mbps total bandwidth for multiple streams
- **Synchronization**: Keeping video feeds synchronized and minimizing latency
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatic quality adjustment based on available resources
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of camera disconnections and network issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Custom grid layouts beyond standard configurations

### Performance and Quality
- [ ] Maintain 30+ FPS with 4-9 cameras displayed simultaneously
- [ ] Maintain 24+ FPS with 16 cameras displayed simultaneously
- [ ] Memory usage scales appropriately with camera count
- [ ] Dynamic video quality scaling based on grid size
- [ ] Graceful degradation when network bandwidth is limited

### User Experience
- [ ] Smooth transitions between grid layouts
- [ ] Responsive UI that doesn't freeze during video operations
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for camera selection and status
- [ ] Intuitive controls for multiview navigation
- [ ] Professional appearance suitable for broadcast environments

## Notes
This feature represents the core differentiating capability of USAALive for professional production environments. The multiview display system should be prioritized in development as it provides immediate value to users and distinguishes the application from basic camera control software.
