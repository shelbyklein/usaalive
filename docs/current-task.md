# Current Task

## Status: Project Setup Complete ✅

### Recently Completed
- ✅ Unity 2022.3.15f1 project initialization
- ✅ Package dependencies setup (Input System 1.7.0, KlakNDI 2.1.4)
- ✅ VISCA protocol command reference integration (161 commands)
- ✅ Project documentation creation (CLAUDE.md, ProjectOverview.md)
- ✅ Git repository setup and GitHub integration
- ✅ Documentation structure organization

### Current Priority: Core Architecture Development

#### Next Immediate Tasks
1. **Multiview Display System**
   - Design grid-based video layout system (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, custom grids)
   - Implement NDI receiver management for multiple simultaneous streams
   - Create camera feed containers with status indicators and labels
   - Build camera selection and switching functionality
   - Add preview/program workflow for professional switching

2. **VISCA Communication Layer**
   - Design TCP/IP communication interface for camera control
   - Implement command packet structure (8x address, FF termination)
   - Create command queue system with priority handling
   - Add error handling and response parsing

3. **Input System Setup**
   - Create Input Action Assets for camera controls and multiview navigation
   - Define action maps for PTZ, Focus, Zoom, Image controls, and camera switching
   - Implement variable speed control for analog inputs
   - Set up device compatibility (gamepad, keyboard, custom controllers)

4. **UI Toolkit Foundation**
   - Design main controller interface layout with integrated multiview display (UXML)
   - Create base styling system for grid layouts and camera status (USS)
   - Implement core UI components for camera control and multiview management
   - Set up responsive design framework supporting dynamic grid sizes

5. **NDI Integration and Performance**
   - Integrate KlakNDI plugin for video streaming and multiview rendering
   - Implement performance optimization for multiple video streams
   - Add video quality management and dynamic resolution scaling
   - Plan camera discovery and connection workflow

### Development Approach
- **Phase 1**: Multiview display system and NDI integration
- **Phase 2**: Core VISCA communication and basic PTZ control
- **Phase 3**: Complete camera function implementation with multiview integration
- **Phase 4**: UI polish and advanced multiview features (custom layouts, tally lights)
- **Phase 5**: Performance optimization for multiple video streams
- **Phase 6**: Testing with actual hardware and multiple cameras

### Blocking Issues
- None currently

### Notes
- Prioritize multiview display as core differentiating feature for live production
- Focus on establishing reliable NDI multiview rendering before camera communication
- Ensure multiview system can handle 4-16 cameras with good performance
- Prioritize PTZ movement as it's the most critical control function (Priority 1)
- Test with actual VISCA-compatible IP cameras and multiple NDI sources when available
- Consider professional broadcast workflow patterns (preview/program, tally systems)
