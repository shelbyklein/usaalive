# Current Task

## Status: Project Setup Complete ✅

### Recently Completed
- ✅ Unity 2022.3.15f1 project initialization
- ✅ Package dependencies setup (Input System 1.7.0, KlakNDI 2.1.4)
- ✅ VISCA protocol command reference integration (161 commands)
- ✅ Project documentation creation (CLAUDE.md, ProjectOverview.md)
- ✅ Git repository setup and GitHub integration
- ✅ Documentation structure organization

### Current Priority: Core Architecture Development

#### Next Immediate Tasks
1. **VISCA Communication Layer**
   - Design TCP/IP communication interface for camera control
   - Implement command packet structure (8x address, FF termination)
   - Create command queue system with priority handling
   - Add error handling and response parsing

2. **Input System Setup**
   - Create Input Action Assets for camera controls
   - Define action maps for PTZ, Focus, Zoom, and Image controls
   - Implement variable speed control for analog inputs
   - Set up device compatibility (gamepad, keyboard, custom controllers)

3. **UI Toolkit Foundation**
   - Design main controller interface layout (UXML)
   - Create base styling system (USS)
   - Implement core UI components for camera control
   - Set up responsive design framework

4. **NDI Integration Planning**
   - Integrate KlakNDI plugin for video streaming
   - Design video feed display within controller interface
   - Plan camera discovery and connection workflow

### Development Approach
- **Phase 1**: Core VISCA communication and basic PTZ control
- **Phase 2**: Complete camera function implementation
- **Phase 3**: UI polish and advanced features
- **Phase 4**: Testing with actual hardware

### Blocking Issues
- None currently

### Notes
- Focus on establishing reliable camera communication first
- Prioritize PTZ movement as it's the most critical function (Priority 1)
- Test with actual VISCA-compatible IP cameras when available
